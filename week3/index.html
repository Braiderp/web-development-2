    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Es6 supports object destructuring</li>
      <li>
        Object destructuring is important because its used heavily in popular
        frameworks such as react
      </li>
      <li>Object destructuring allows you to write much cleaner code.</li>
      <li>There is a Document Object Model or Dom</li>
      <li>
        Many frameworks such as react and vuejs use whats called a virtual dom
        witch is faster in general
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Object Destructuring example</p>
    <code>
      const obj = {name: "Braiden", age: 24}; const {name, age} = obj; //name =
      Braiden; // age = 24;
    </code>
    <p>But i can also do this in a function like so</p>
    <code>
      function display({name, age}){ return ` hello, ${name} you are ${age}` }
      display(obj);
    </code>

    <p>I can do this with arrays</p>
    <code>
      const array = ["bob", "21", "single"]; const [name, age, status] = array;
      // name = bob as its the first element. age = 21 as it is the second and
      status = single
    </code>

    <p>
      Spiritual question, with everything going on in the world it can seem
      scary at times. Jesus said "fear not". While no one knows the day nor the
      hour, now more than ever it seems as though "summer is nigh" and his
      coming is close. That could be just me but I don't know what else to
      think. What are some things you have done personally to not be afraid of
      what is to come?
