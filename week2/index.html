    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Computed Properties can be made like this:
        <code
          >const hulk = { name: 'Hulk', ['catch' + 'Phrase']: 'Hulk Smash!'
          };</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        The script above would make an object like so:
        <code>{ name: 'Hulk', catchPhrase: 'Hulk Smash!' }</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use expressions such as ternary operators when creating objects
        like so
        <code
          >const captainBritain = { name: 'Captain Britain', hero: bewitched ?
          false : true };</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation</li>
      <li>The Epoch is 1st January 1970</li>
      <li>
        jQuery is a popular JavaScript framework that makes it very easy to find
        elements on a page using a CSS-style syntax.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warning: Be careful when updating className. Changing the className
        property of an element by assignment will overwrite all other classes
        that have already been set on the element. This problem can be avoided
        by using the classList property instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        The classList property is a list of all the classes an element has. It
        has a number of methods that make it easier to modify the class of an
        element. Itâ€™s supported in all modern browsers and in Internet Explorer
        from version 10 onwards.
      </li>
      <li>
        When using classList the add/remove method can be used to add/remove a
        class to an element without overwriting any classes that already exist.
      </li>
      <li>removeEventListener removes an removes an event listener</li>
      <li>addEventListener adds a event listener</li>
      <li>
        Note that you shouldn't use anonymous functions as an argument to
        addEventListener() if you want to remove it later. This is because there
        needs to be a reference to the same function name in the arguments of
        removeEventListener().
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Why does everyone use JSON if you cannot attach methods to it? Is it
        faster?
      </li>
      <li>
        Thats interesting that vanilla js has computed properties. If this is
        the case why do so many frameworks like have their own way of creating
        computed properties?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is Javascript as fast as a computer code language? What would be the
        fastest language to handle complex math operations?
      </li>
      <li>
        It says in the reading that " there is a potential problem looming in
        2038 when the number of seconds since the Epoch will be greater than
        2,147,483,647, which is the maximum value that many computers can deal
        with as a signed 32-bit integer" is this really a problem to be
        concerned about? Don't most people have 64 bit operating systems?
      </li>
      <li>
        Quick off topic question will we be using Nodejs and express in this
        course?
      </li>
      <li>
        What programing language do you use in your job. What have you found to
        be most valuable?
