        localStorage is a way to have persistent data based on the domain
        without the use of a database. This data will remain until cleared.
      </li>
      <li>localStorage can be accessed using window.localStorage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I should remember the following functions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>setItem</li>
      <li>removeItem</li>
      <li>getItem</li>

        I have been developing websites for over 3 years now. Primarily I use
        Vuejs for my front end do you happen to know if Vuex uses localStorage
        behind the scenes to provide persistent state?
      </li>

        Is vanilla js going out of style? I mean I use it in my work when I have
        to do something super complicated but for the most part I use libraries
        to handel the heavy lifting. Are there still a lot of companies that
        write vanilla js?
      </li>

        The only time I've really used localStorage is to handel login state.
        What other valid use cases are there? Is it a major security risk to use
        localStorage.
