    <h1>Week 9</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Window is javascripts global object.</p>
    <p>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel:</p>       
    <p>Here is an example of the confirm function: <code>
        window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');
    </code></p>
    <p>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned:</p>
    <p>Here is an example of the window prompt method: <code>window.prompt('Please enter your name:');</code>
    </p>
    <p>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser calls a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint. The method takes a callback as an argument to be invoked before the repaint.</p>
    <p>The window.screen object provides information about the userâ€™s screen.</p>
    <p>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</p>
